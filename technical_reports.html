              Abstract
              <p>
                Recent advances in the field of natural language processing has improved state-of-the-art performances on many tasks including question answering for languages like English. Bengali language is ranked seventh and is spoken by about 300 million people all over the world. But due to lack of data and active research on QA similar progress has not been achieved for Bengali. Unlike English, there is no benchmark large scale QA dataset collected for Bengali, no pretrained language model that can be modified for Bengali question answering and no human baseline score for QA has been established either. In this work we use state-of-the-art transformer models to train QA system on a synthetic reading comprehension dataset translated from one of the most popular benchmark datasets in English called SQuAD 2.0. We collect a smaller human annotated QA dataset from Bengali Wikipedia with popular topics from Bangladeshi culture for evaluating our models. Finally, we compare our models with human children to set up a benchmark score using survey experiments.

              <br>
              Abstract
              <p>
                In this study, Random Forest Regressor, Linear Regression, Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) and Fully connected Neural Network (FCNN) models are leveraged for predicting unconfined compression coefficient with respect to standard penetration test (N-value), depth and soil type. The study is focused on a particular correlation of undrained shear strength of clay (Cu) with the standard penetration strength. The data used is from 14 no. ward in Mymensingh and Rangamati districts which are situated in Bangladesh. By using this data, the study tries to solidify the correlation of SPT (N-value) with Cu. It also tries to check the goodness of the relationship by comparing it with unconfined compression strength values gained from the unconfined compression test calculated from the field by experts.

              Abstract
              <p>
                In this study, General Regression Neural Network(GRNN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Linear Regression (LR) models have been implemented in order to predict the composition of soil with respect to the Standard Penetration Test (SPT), and soil depth. The primary focus has been on determining a significant correlation between the soil composition with SPT value and depth. Data sets have been used from ward 14, Mymensingh district of Bangladesh and from a construction project along India-Myanmar border. In this study, 8 types of soil, namely, fine sand, silty clay, clayey silt with fine sand, clayey silt, fine sand with silt, silty fine sand, sandy silt, and rubbish has been classified, and the probability of obtaining the soil type classification has been determined.

              Abstract
              <p>
                BERT, Bidirectional Encoder Representation from
                Transformers is a masked language model that has created a stir
                in the Machine Learning people community by exhibiting state
                of the art results in about a wide assortment of NLP problems,
                including Question Answering (SQuAD v1.1), Natural Language
                Inference (MNLI), and others. In this project , we use BERT to
                extract features and word embedding vectors from Bangla text
                input.

              Abstract
              <p>
                Summarization has long been a significant area of concern in the field of Natural Language Processing, mostly due to the its dependency on human intervention. In this study, we use a denoising autoencoder, BART, to carry out abstractive summarization on the dataset of COVID-19, using ROUGE scores as an evaluation metric. The primary focus of the study has been the use of medical articles based on COVID-19, which is aimed to provide a significant support for the research purpose during the pandemic.

              <br>
              Abstract
              <p>
                Summarization is the task of gathering bits of texts
                to a shorter adaptation that contains the principle information
                from the source document. A lot of progress has been achieved
                recently using NLP to attain high standard summary. This paper

                is an extensive analysis on the trends seen in text summariza-
                tion. It mainly focuses on the two main kinds: extractive and

                abstractive text summarization. There are quite a few obstacles
                in achieving high quality summarization, mainly because of
                its subjectivity. The evaluation metrics like ROUGE support
                extractive summarization, and there has been significant progress
                in this field. But it is believed that to achieve truly high quality
                summarization capability, we must progress with abstractive
                summarization, because this way it will be close to human-like
                summarization.

              Abstract
              <p>
                Topic segmentation is an important initial step in most natural language processing tasks. It
                aims to determine the border between the top blocks
                in a text, helping in semantic analysis. This technique
                is used to improve the access to information. This
                technique helps in detecting the segments of topics
                from the entire text data. When the segments are
                determined , they can be used to create
